	Nvidia has been my companion ever since I discovered my childhood passion for graphics-intensive games. GeForce cards have been the only dedicated graphics card I use. I enjoy artificial reality, and I spent countless hours tuning graphics plugins and writing my own shaders. Furthermore, the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning excites me just as much. It is my dream to join and experience the one field that I can feel constant pleasure working in: a combination of game technologies and deep learning.
	% Uber has been the leading company that completely changed the transportation industry. I have read about Uber's advancements in autonomous vehicles, and have also been using your apps almost on a daily basis. The Uber ATG's primary interest is in cutting-edge ML research; Since I am aspiring to apply my ML knowledge in the industry, as well as gaining experience in research, this will be an excellent opportunity for me to contribute to the team's interest.
